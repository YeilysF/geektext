# CEN 4010 Project: GeekText

An online web application bookstore which targets a particular niche in technology. The application named, # GeekText (think of Thinkgeek meets Barnes & Noble) will support the following features:

## Feature 1: Book Browsing and Sorting

Users will have a simple and enjoyable way to discover new books and
Authors and sort results.

DESCRIPTION: Allow user to browse books by genre, top sellers in our
book store, and book rating with pagination based on 10 or 20 results. Allow Sort by
book title, author, price, book rating, and release date.

## Feature 2: Profile Management

Users can create and maintain their profiles rather than enter in
their information each time they order

DESCRIPTION: Users can manage their login credentials (ID,
password), personal information (name, email address, home
address), nickname for book rating and commenting, credit card
information (multiple), and shipping address (multiple). Physical
addresses, email addresses, and credit card info should be
verified as valid. Passwords must meet our current security
standards

## Feature 3: Shopping Cart

Users can manage items in a shopping cart for immediate or future
Purchase

DESCRIPTION: Users can easily access their cart from any page, view
the same information displayed in the book list, change the quantity,
remove it from their cart or save it for later. A subtotal for all items in
their shopping cart should be displayed at the bottom. Items saved for
later should appear below that.

## Feature 4: Book Details

Users can see informative and enticing details about a book

DESCRIPTION: Display book name, book cover (which can be enlarged
when clicked), author and bio, book description, genre, publishing info
(publisher, release date, etc.), book rating, and comments. Hyperlink
author’s name to a list of other books by the same author.

## Feature 5: Book Rating and Commenting

Users can rate AND comment on books they’ve purchased to help others in their
selection

DESCRIPTION: For Rating: Use a five-star rating system. Users can only rate a book
if they’ve purchased it, and may select whether they show their nickname
(defined in their profile) or remain anonymous. For Commenting: A single comment
should be limited to the number of
characters, which can fit within half the browser window (so that there
are at least two comments which can appear at the same time). Users
can only comment on a book if they’ve purchased it, and may select
whether they show their nickname (defined in their profile) or remain
anonymous.

## Feature 6: Wish List Management

Users can create and have 3 different wish lists which can have books moved to
from the primary list.

DESCRIPTION: There will be a section called wish lists, in which the user can create
up to 3 new lists and give them different names. Each list can show the items that
have been added to the list and each item can be added to the cart. Items can be
added to the different lists from the item details page. Items can be removed from
any list in this section. Items can be transferred from one wish list to another
